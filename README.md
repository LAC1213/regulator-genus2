# Regulators of Curves of Genus Two

Given a separable polynomial `f(x)` of degree 5 or 6 with rational coefficients, we aim to compute the following quantities.

- The periods `c^-, c^+` of the hyperelliptic curve `C: y^2 = f(x)`.
- The value of the L function of `Sym^2 H^1(C)` at `s = 2`.
- The value of the integral over the complex plane of the function `z log(|a + z|)/|f(z)|`.
